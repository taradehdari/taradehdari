# 👋 Hi, I'm Tara Dehdari!

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Data Science Master's student, graduating in December 2024, with a background in Physiology and Neuroscience (B.S). I am passionate about healthcare data science and predictive modeling.

## 🌱 Current Project
- **Capstone Project:** "Food Recommendations for Diabetic Patients"
      - **Objective:** Building a personalized food recommendation system for diabetic patients.
      - **Method:** Hybrid model using collaborative and content-based filtering.
  
## 📚 Past Projects
- **Literary Analysis of Fiction vs. Nonfiction**
   - **Goal**: Conducted a comparative analysis of fiction and nonfiction texts, exploring themes of gender roles, society, and individual rights.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, NLP, scikit-learn, NLTK
   - **Outcome**: Applied topic modeling and sentiment analysis to reveal thematic contrasts, using works like *"Pride and Prejudice"* by Jane Austen and *"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"* by Mary Wollstonecraft.
