# 👋 Hi, I'm Tara Dehdari!

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Data Science Master's student, graduating in December 2024, with a background in Physiology and Neuroscience (B.S). I am passionate about healthcare data science and predictive modeling.

## 🌱 Current Project
- **Capstone Project:** "Food Recommendations for Diabetic Patients"
      - **Objective:** Building a personalized food recommendation system for diabetic patients.
      - **Method:** Hybrid model using collaborative and content-based filtering.
  
## 📚 Past Projects
- **Sentiment Analysis of Music Lyrics and Twitter Data**
   - **Goal**: Used natural language processing techniques to analyze sentiment in song lyrics and Twitter posts for artists like Robyn and Cher.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
   - **Outcome**: Visualized sentiment trends and identified common themes in artists' lyrical and social media content.
- **Fashion Review Classification**
   - **Goal**: Classified customer reviews from an online shopping dataset to predict user satisfaction based on product fit and style.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, t-SNE, pandas
   - **Outcome**: Achieved improved accuracy by tuning classification models, enabling better insights into customer preferences.
- **Image Processing for Cat Face Detection**
   - **Goal**: Developed an image processing pipeline for detecting and analyzing grayscale images of cat faces.
   - **Tech Stack**: OpenCV, scikit-image, Python
   - **Outcome**: Applied PCA to identify key facial features, contributing to understanding of image decomposition and facial structure analysis.
- **Audio Emotion Classification**
   - **Goal**: Built a classifier to predict human emotions from audio recordings, focusing on detecting emotions like happiness, anger, and sadness.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, Librosa
   - **Outcome**: Created a prototype model with potential applications in sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.
