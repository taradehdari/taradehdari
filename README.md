# 👋 Hi, I'm Tara Dehdari!

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Data Scientist with a background in Physiology and Neuroscience (B.S.) and a Master’s degree in Applied Data Science, focused on using data to inform decisions and create measurable impact. My work spans machine learning, analytics, and statistical modeling, with experience applying these skills to real-world problems. As Director of Technology at Women for Wolves, a nonprofit conservation organization, I build and support data and digital systems that help drive conservation efforts, operational efficiency, and community outreach. I’m interested in roles where, as a data scientist, I can leverage data to inform decision-making and create meaningful, real-world impact across industries.

🎓 Education:
   - M.S. in Applied Data Science (University of San Diego, Jan 2025, 3.9 gpa)
   - B.S. in Physiology and Neuroscience (University of California San Diego, July 2018)
